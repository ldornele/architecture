# Maestro Architecture Deep Dive

## Core Architecture

### System Components

| Component | Description | Responsibilities |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Maestro Server** | Central orchestrator | Resource storage, CloudEvent publishing, API endpoints |
| **Maestro Agent** | Cluster-side executor | Resource application, status reporting |
| **PostgreSQL** | Persistent storage | Resource metadata, status tracking, event history |
| **Message Brokers** | Event transport | CloudEvent delivery between server and agents |

### Key Design Principles

- **Event-driven architecture** using CloudEvents
- **Scalable** to 200,000+ clusters without linear infrastructure scaling
- **Broker-agnostic** supporting MQTT, gRPC, GCP Pub/Sub, and AWS IoT
- **Single binary** with different subcommands for server/agent roles

### Architectural Rationale

Maestro uses an **event-driven architecture** where:

1. **HTTP API** → Read-only access for monitoring and metadata (consumers)
2. **gRPC/CloudEvents** → Actual ManifestWork lifecycle operations (create, update, delete)
3. **Event Controllers** → Process gRPC events and update database

**Why this design:**
- **Scalability:** gRPC is more efficient for high-volume ManifestWork operations
- **Real-time:** CloudEvents provide immediate delivery to agents
- **Consistency:** Event-driven system ensures proper ordering and delivery
- **Monitoring:** HTTP API provides simple REST interface for dashboards

## Maestro Event Flow and Processing Patterns

### CloudEvents Data Flow Architecture

```
Maestro Server ←→ gRPC CloudEvents Stream ←→ Client (Watch API)
```

**Key Finding**: In **gRPC mode**, Maestro uses an **integrated gRPC broker** - no external message broker required. See [Deployment Modes](#deployment-modes) section for broker-specific details.

### Watch Processing Patterns

#### **Watch Implementation Architecture**
```
workClient.ManifestWorks(consumerName).Watch(ctx, metav1.ListOptions{})
```

**Key Finding**: Watch uses **hybrid approach** - HTTP REST API for initial state + CloudEvents for live updates!

**Watch Processing Flow:**
1. **Initial List**: HTTP REST API call to `/api/maestro/v1/resource-bundles`
2. **CloudEvents Subscription**: Subscribe for real-time ManifestWork changes
3. **Event Handler**: Process incoming CloudEvents and forward to watch channel

**Connection & Protocol Details:**
- **Protocol**: gRPC CloudEvents streaming (not HTTP polling)
- **Authentication**: TLS/mTLS or token-based
- **Filtering**: By consumerName (target cluster) and sourceID (client identifier)
- **Performance**: Synchronous initial load + asynchronous live updates

#### **Direct CloudEvents Subscription (Alternative)**
```
Client → CloudEventsClient.Subscribe() → CloudEvents Stream (Skip Watch API)
```

**Characteristics:**
- **Transport**: Direct CloudEvents subscription (bypass Watch wrapper)
- **Data Source**: Live CloudEvent stream only (no initial REST API call)
- **Performance**: Highest throughput, but loses initial state synchronization
- **Use Case**: Event-driven processing where current state not required

### Event Processing Volume Analysis

#### **High-Volume Event Scenarios**
Based on our analysis of thousands of events every 10 seconds:

**Processing Approaches:**

1. **Sequential Processing** (Standard)
   - Process each Watch event individually
   - **Capacity**: 50-100 events per 10-second window
   - **Bottleneck**: Sequential event handling blocks subsequent events

2. **Parallel Processing** (High-Volume)
   - Single Watch goroutine + multiple worker goroutines
   - **Capacity**: 1,000+ events per 10-second window
   - **Architecture**: One connection feeding multiple processors

3. **Event-Driven Processing** (Enterprise Scale)
   - Pure event subscription without Watch API
   - **Capacity**: 10,000+ events per second
   - **Architecture**: Direct broker subscription with event transformation

### Connection Management

#### **gRPC Mode (Recommended)**
- **One gRPC connection per client** to Maestro server
- **SourceID-based filtering**: Each client gets events filtered by its sourceID
- **No message competition**: Each client receives independent event stream
- **Authentication**: TLS/mTLS or token-based

#### **MQTT/Pub-Sub Mode**
- See [Deployment Modes](#deployment-modes) section for broker-specific details
- **Key difference**: Potential message competition depending on topic design

### Event Deduplication and Filtering

#### **Event Characteristics**
- **Status Updates**: Frequent condition changes generate multiple events
- **Generation Tracking**: API generation correlation for conflict resolution
- **Event Ordering**: CloudEvents provide sequencing and delivery guarantees

#### **Filtering Strategies**
- **Label-based**: Filter by cluster ID, resource type, adapter name
- **Generation-based**: Process only newer generation events
- **SourceID-based**: Events filtered by client's sourceID parameter

## Communication Protocols

### HTTP REST API

**Use Cases:** Consumer management and monitoring only

- **Authentication:** JWT Bearer tokens (optional - can be disabled for development)
- **Format:** JSON over HTTP/HTTPS
- **Documentation:** OpenAPI specification available

### gRPC Communication

**Use Cases:** Real-time resource delivery, ManifestWork lifecycle operations

- **Authentication:** TLS, mTLS, or token-based
- **Operations:** CloudEvents publish/subscribe, streaming, ManifestWork CRUD
- **Format:** Protocol Buffers over HTTP/2
- **Performance:** Lower latency, smaller payload size

### Subscription Pre-setup Requirements

**⚠️ Broker-specific setup requirements:**
- **gRPC**: Dynamic subscriptions (no pre-setup needed)
- **MQTT**: Topic structure must be configured during Maestro deployment
- **GCP Pub/Sub**: Topics and subscriptions must be created before use
- **AWS IoT**: IoT Things, device certificates, and policies required

---

## Event Consumption Patterns

### Consumption Models by Broker

| **Broker Type** | **Consumption Pattern** | **Multiple Subscribers** | **Setup Complexity** |
|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| **gRPC** | Independent streams (broadcast) | ✅ Safe - each gets own stream | Low (dynamic) |
| **MQTT** | Topic-based queuing | ⚠️ Competing consumers | Medium (topic structure) |
| **GCP Pub/Sub** | Subscription-based | ✅ Configurable | Medium (topics + IAM) |
| **AWS IoT** | Topic routing | ⚠️ Similar to MQTT | High (Things + certs + policies) |

### Event Consumption Risks

**⚠️ MQTT/AWS IoT Risk:** Queue-based consumption means multiple subscribers compete for messages:
- **Message consumption conflict** - only one subscriber receives each message
- **Unintended message loss** - if Maestro server and your client both subscribe
- **Mitigation**: Use separate topics or unique client IDs

**✅ gRPC Safe Pattern:** Broadcast streaming - multiple subscribers each receive independent copies of all events.

---

## API Capabilities

> **Key Finding:** ManifestWork lifecycle operations (apply, update, delete) are **only available via gRPC**, not HTTP. The HTTP API is intentionally limited to read operations and consumer management.

### API Endpoint Support Matrix

| API Endpoint | GET | POST | DELETE | Purpose |
|--------------|-----|------|--------|---------|
| `/api/maestro/v1/consumers` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Consumer metadata management |
| `/api/maestro/v1/resource-bundles` | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ManifestWork status/monitoring |

### API Design Rationale

**Why HTTP is Read-Only for Resources:**
- **Performance:** gRPC more efficient for high-volume ManifestWork operations
- **Real-time:** CloudEvents provide immediate delivery to agents
- **Scalability:** Event-driven system handles large cluster counts better
- **Consistency:** gRPC ensures proper ordering and delivery guarantees

**HTTP API Use Cases:**
- Dashboard monitoring and reporting
- Consumer (cluster) management
- Status queries and filtering
- Operational tooling and scripts

---

## ManifestWork Integration

### Resource Model

Maestro works with **ManifestWork** resources (Open Cluster Management API) but does **NOT require ACM operator**:

- Uses Open Cluster Management APIs (`open-cluster-management.io/api`) for resource definitions
- Implements custom transport layer via CloudEvents
- Self-contained control plane with PostgreSQL storage

### Resource vs ManifestWork Relationship

```yaml
# ManifestWork is stored as a "resource" in Maestro
apiVersion: work.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: ManifestWork
metadata:
  name: test-manifestwork
  namespace: consumer-cluster
spec:
  workload:
    manifests: [...]
```

This becomes a Maestro `resource` with:
- **consumer_name:** Target cluster
- **manifest:** The ManifestWork YAML
- **type:** `ManifestWork`

## Security Architecture

### Authentication Layers

1. **HTTP API Authentication**
   - JWT Bearer tokens (optional for development)
   - Red Hat SSO integration
   - Role-based access control

2. **gRPC Authentication**
   - TLS/mTLS for transport security
   - Certificate-based client authentication (mTLS)

3. **Agent Authentication**
   - mTLS between server and agents
   - Service account management
   - Certificate rotation strategy

### Network Security

- **TLS encryption** for all communications
- **Network policies** to restrict access between components
- **Firewall rules** for broker access
- **VPN/Private networks** for cross-cluster communication

---

## Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics

- **Resource delivery latency**: Time from submission to application
- **Agent connection status**: Healthy/unhealthy agent connections
- **CloudEvents processing rates**: Events per second throughput
- **Database performance**: Query latency, connection pools
- **gRPC connection health**: Stream status, connection errors

### Logging Strategy

```yaml
# Configurable log levels
- name: KLOG_V
  value: "2"  # Adjust verbosity as needed
```

### Alerting Scenarios

- Agent disconnections
- Resource application failures
- Database connection issues
- Message broker downtime
- Certificate expiration warnings
